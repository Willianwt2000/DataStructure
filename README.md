# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms Mastery - 1 Month Challenge

Welcome to my dedicated repository for a **one-month intensive study of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. This project is a structured journey to master fundamental DSA concepts and hone problem-solving skills crucial for technical interviews and efficient software development.

-----

## 🎯 Project Goals

The primary aim of this month-long challenge is to build a robust understanding of core data structures and common algorithms. Through focused learning and hands-on practice, I intend to:

  * **Deepen Understanding of Core Datkja Structures:** Gain proficiency in arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash maps, and more.
  * **Master Algorithmic Paradigms:** Learn and apply various algorithmic approaches, including searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming (intro), and greedy algorithms.
  * **Excel in Algorithmic Problem Solving:** Practice extensively on platforms like LeetCode to apply theoretical knowledge to practical coding challenges.
  * **Analyze Time and Space Complexity:** Develop a strong intuition for evaluating algorithm efficiency using Big O notation.
  * **Prepare for Technical Interviews:** Equip myself with the necessary skills and confidence to tackle complex coding problems posed in technical interviews.

## 🗓️ Monthly Breakdown

This repository is organized week by week, reflecting a progressive learning path. Each week focuses on specific data structures and related algorithmic problems.

  * **[Week 1: Arrays & Big O Notation](https://www.google.com/search?q=WEEK_1_README.md)**

      * **Focus:** Introduction to DSA, understanding Big O, and in-depth exploration of arrays (static, dynamic, multi-dimensional).
      * **Practice:** Fundamental array manipulation problems on LeetCode.

  * **[Week 2: Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues](https://www.google.com/search?q=WEEK_2_README.md)** (Placeholder - create this file when you start Week 2)

      * **Focus:** Understanding linear data structures like singly, doubly, and circular linked lists, along with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stacks and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues.
      * **Practice:** Problems involving list manipulation and stack/queue applications.

  * **[Week 3: Trees & Basic Graphs](https://www.google.com/search?q=WEEK_3_README.md)** (Placeholder - create this file when you start Week 3)

      * **Focus:** Introduction to non-linear data structures, including binary trees, Binary Search Trees (BSTs), and basic graph representations and traversals (BFS, DFS).
      * **Practice:** Tree traversal, BST operations, and graph search problems.

  * **[Week 4: Hash Maps/Sets & General Review](https://www.google.com/search?q=WEEK_4_README.md)** (Placeholder - create this file when you start Week 4)

      * **Focus:** Deep dive into hash tables and hash sets, their internal workings, and powerful applications for efficient lookups. Optional introduction to Heaps.
      * **Practice:** Problems leveraging hash-based structures for optimized solutions, plus a comprehensive review of all concepts.
