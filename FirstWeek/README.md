# ðŸ“š Data Structures and Algorithms - Week 1: Arrays

This repository documents my progress and solutions during the first week of intensive study on Data Structures and Algorithms, with a primary focus on **Arrays**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Week 1 Objectives

This week's main goal is to build a solid foundation in understanding and manipulating **Arrays**, as well as to familiarize myself with fundamental algorithmic complexity concepts.

The key points I'm focusing on are:

* **Understanding Big O Notation:** Learning to analyze the time and space efficiency of algorithms.
* **Array Fundamentals:** Grasping what arrays are, how they work internally, and their basic operations (access, insertion, deletion).
* **Types of Arrays:** Differentiating between static and dynamic arrays, and exploring multi-dimensional arrays.
* **Array Manipulation:** Practicing common techniques like traversing, searching, and modifying elements within arrays.
* **Problem Solving:** Applying acquired knowledge to solve common algorithmic problems on platforms like LeetCode.

## ðŸš€ LeetCode Exercises Solved

Below is a list of LeetCode problems I'm tackling this week to solidify my understanding of arrays and algorithmic complexity. You can find the solutions in their respective folders within this repository.

* [**Two Sum**](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
    * **Key Concept:** Efficient pair finding.
    * **Approach:** Exploring brute-force solutions and improving efficiency with auxiliary data structures.
* [**Valid Parentheses**](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
    * **Key Concept:** Data structure simulation (initially without an explicit stack, focusing on a counting or simple traversal approach).
    * **Approach:** Validating sequences using balance logic.
* [**Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)
    * **Key Concept:** In-place array manipulation and using multiple pointers.
    * **Approach:** Optimizing space by modifying the existing array.
* [**Merge Sorted Array**](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)
    * **Key Concept:** Merging sorted arrays.
    * **Approach:** Combining two sorted arrays into a single one efficiently.

## ðŸ’¡ Reflections and Learnings

Each problem and concept helps me better understand how to choose the right data structure to optimize an algorithm's performance. Arrays, though fundamental, serve as the basis for many other more complex structures.

I'm excited about what I'll learn in the coming weeks!
