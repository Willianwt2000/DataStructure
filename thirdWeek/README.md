# ðŸ“š Data Structures and Algorithms - Week X: Hash Tables  

This repository documents my progress and solutions during Week X of intensive study on Data Structures and Algorithms, focusing on **Hash Tables**.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Week Objectives  
The primary goal is to build a deep understanding of **Hash Tables**, their implementation, optimization, and real-world applications.  

Key focus areas:  
- **Hash Table Fundamentals:**  
  - Structure (arrays + hash functions), trade-offs vs. arrays/trees.  
  - Time complexity analysis (average vs. worst case).  
- **Hash Functions:**  
  - Designing effective hash functions for uniform key distribution.  
  - Collision resolution (separate chaining, open addressing).  
- **Types of Hash Tables:**  
  - Static vs. dynamic resizing.  
  - Built-in implementations (Python dictionaries, Java `HashMap`).  
- **Core Operations:**  
  - Insertion, lookup, deletion, and rehashing.  
- **Practical Applications:**  
  - Caching (e.g., LRU Cache), databases, substring search (Rabin-Karp).
