# ðŸ“š Data Structures and Algorithms - Week 2: Linked Lists

This repository documents my progress and solutions during the second week of intensive study on Data Structures and Algorithms, with a primary focus on **Linked Lists**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Week 2 Objectives

This week's main goal is to build a solid foundation in understanding and manipulating **Linked Lists**, as well as to explore different variations and their applications in problem-solving.

The key points I'm focusing on are:

* **Linked List Fundamentals:** Understanding the basic structure of nodes and pointers, and how they differ from arrays.
* **Types of Linked Lists:** Exploring singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
* **Linked List Operations:** Mastering insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching operations.
* **Two-Pointer Technique:** Learning how to use multiple pointers to solve complex linked list problems efficiently.
* **Problem Solving:** Applying linked list concepts to solve algorithmic problems on platforms like LeetCode.

## ðŸš€ LeetCode Exercises Solved

Below is a list of LeetCode problems I'm tackling this week to solidify my understanding of linked lists and advanced pointer manipulation. You can find the solutions in their respective folders within this repository.

* [**Reverse Linked List**](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
    * **Key Concept:** Pointer manipulation and iterative/recursive approaches.
    * **Approach:** Using multiple pointers to reverse the direction of links.
* [**Linked List Cycle**](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
    * **Key Concept:** Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Fast and Slow Pointer).
    * **Approach:** Detecting cycles using two pointers moving at different speeds.
* [**Merge Two Sorted Lists**](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
    * **Key Concept:** Merging sorted linked lists efficiently.
    * **Approach:** Comparing nodes and building a new sorted list.
* [**Remove Nth Node From End of List**](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
    * **Key Concept:** Two-pointer technique for finding nodes from the end.
    * **Approach:** Using a gap between two pointers to locate the target node.
* [**Palindrome Linked List**](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)
    * **Key Concept:** Reversing half of the list and comparing.
    * **Approach:** Finding the middle, reversing the second half, and comparing with the first half.

## ðŸ’¡ Reflections and Learnings

Linked lists introduce a different way of thinking about data organization compared to arrays. The pointer-based nature requires careful attention to memory management and edge cases. The two-pointer technique has become a powerful tool in my problem-solving arsenal.

I'm excited to continue exploring more complex data structures in the coming weeks!
